# Regression Model for Iraqi Secondary School Dataset

This project aims to create a regression model for predicting students' marks based on various factors collected from three Iraqi secondary schools.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 120 samples with 55 features, including demographic, economic, educational, time, and marks-related attributes. The dataset was collected by submitting questionnaires to Iraqi secondary schools during the second semester of 2018. The dataset was pre-processed to remove inconsistencies and incompleteness.

## Model Performance Metrics

The regression model created for this dataset achieved the following performance metrics:

- R2 score: 0.9962494419299771
- Explained variance score (EVS): 0.9963856989758303
- Mean absolute percentage error (DPS): 0.9366169893845943

These metrics indicate that the model has a high level of accuracy in predicting students' marks based on the given features.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using regression models for predicting students' academic performance based on various factors. The dataset used in this project provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to academic success in Iraqi secondary schools. This model can be further improved by incorporating additional features and expanding the dataset.
